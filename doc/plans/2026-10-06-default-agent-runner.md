# Runner defaults: staged delivery

Updated 2026-10-09.

## Outcome and ownership

Users choose a harness. New agents use Paperclip Runner where the harness and
execution target are qualified. Existing agents keep their recorded runner.
The task owns implementation, verification, review fixes, and reviewable PRs.
Merging and deployment require separate authorization.

The original implementation is preserved on `codex/default-agent-runner` at
`171d841295808ca185a258aaeb10b3dee68bb2b9`. Its public review is
[PR #15422](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/15422).
The user approved splitting that work into four useful steps:

1. Packaged runtime reliability and Codex prerequisites, without changing defaults.
2. Codex defaults across creation, onboarding, hiring, imports, and the UI.
3. Claude defaults and authentication.
4. The remaining supported harness defaults and provider-specific fixes.

## Completed prerequisite

[PR #15555](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/15555) merged at
`6f9d0a56ba3c2f0059a723b7de434320eed7eb22`. Its final candidate `dde37d7`
passed 47 ordinary CI jobs and fresh 5/5 automated review. The actual clean Linux
npm consumer checked all 17 tarballs for absent Codex native payloads and official
npm host dependencies. Actual Codex 0.156.1 startup passed on macOS ARM64.
[Bot lockfile refresh #15673](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/15673)
is merged. These checks did not qualify onboarding or cloud rollout.

Removed prerequisite work remains on `codex/runner-packaging-full-snapshot` at
`6f3060beaa842ffcee21af058370d3cab5f571e9`. Do not restore its release workflows,
Docker materialization, Git installer, or extra login isolation wholesale.

## Current slice: Codex defaults

Authorized 2026-10-09. Canonical branch: `codex/codex-runner-default`.
Master base: `57e977be7` (includes both prerequisite merges and Pi integration).
Canonical PR: [draft #15683](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/15683).
Initial CI candidate: `8ce217b71`. Scoped environment discovery and native import
preservation are committed at `5ba1bc986`; the final follow-up preserves saved
model, effort, and timeout through runner-only built-in configuration changes.
Preview: [isolated Codex QA](http://127.0.0.1:3125), normal dev supervisor,
separate empty database. Current-head live evidence is pending the source freeze
and verified binary provenance; older services and artifacts are not proof.

New Codex agents select Paperclip Runner on qualified Linux x64 targets. Users
choose Codex, with Paperclip Runner or Legacy runner inside Advanced. Other
harness defaults stay unchanged. Existing legacy/native agents and ordinary
edits retain recorded execution; explicit runner changes use revisions/session
invalidation. No database migration or permission-policy change.

Resolve before validation/auth/instructions/skills at the common creation
boundary. Cover direct/API/CLI creation, onboarding seeds, hires, frozen
approvals, built-ins, plugins, and import/export. Unsupported platforms or active
external overrides retain legacy selection. Missing dependencies, invalid models,
authentication failures, and incompatible settings remain actionable errors,
without silently choosing another runner. Native Codex bypasses the experimental
gate; other native providers retain their existing gate.

Finish line: one narrow reviewable PR, affected regressions and required checks
passing, useful Codex tasks plus follow-up and independently checked artifacts,
onboarding and existing-agent preservation verified locally and on qualified
managed staging, and inspectable evidence. Human merge and production deployment
remain separate actions. Actual production composition remains a post-merge gate.

## Coverage and execution ownership

Reuse Product E2E profiles, fixtures, graders, reports, and installation checks.
The `first-task` native Codex case now inspects the wizard's saved default directly
with the experimental flag disabled. The legacy control selects its override
before authentication. Each isolated onboarding company has a $5 task budget;
setup probes require their own reserved allowance.
Claude's explicit native fixture is unchanged until its later default PR.

| Area | Owner | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared contract, server resolution, setup readiness | Core worker | 88 selection/setup, 39 route/artifact and 6 transport controls pass; server noemit passes; rebuilt daemon and Linux DB proof pending |
| Production create/edit/onboarding UI and stories | UI worker | Implemented; 339 affected tests, UI typecheck and token gates pass; story evidence in progress |
| Built-ins, plugins, approvals, imports/exports, CLI | Creation-path worker | Implemented; 102 portability, 8 approval, 3 CLI and 3 built-in unit checks pass; 72 DB checks require Linux |
| Execution/dev gate, E2E gaps, packaging, live journeys | Lead | 28 runtime-selection and 122 onboarding/catalog support checks pass; actual journeys pending |
| Full CI and final review | Lead | Initial Linux CI and Greptile running on `8ce217b71`; final-head verification pending |
| Local API/subscription task + follow-up | Lead | Credential/runtime identity inventory; unverified on this branch |
| Managed staging API/subscription onboarding | Lead | Exact-source preview/artifact and budget qualification pending |
| Shipped npm/Docker/cloud artifacts | Lead | Reuse existing hosted checks; prerequisite packaging proof is historical |

Keep CPU-heavy Rust/Docker builds in hosted CI. Use Node 24, bounded workers,
conservative provider turns/timeouts and existing QA accounts. Login interactions
use the embedded browser. Do not change user preview services or production.

The original $250 ceiling remains. Historical receipts include unknown-charge
reserves; the latest retained ledger holds $248.18 in costs/reservations and
reports $1.82 unallocated, not a certified invoice balance. Reconcile unstarted
reservations and current resource/credential state before paid runs. Do not reset
the ceiling or treat missing charges as zero. No new paid call has run in this
slice. Keep exact source/artifact/runtime identities and failed attempts in the
existing report pipeline; mocks and passing CI do not close live acceptance.

Integration found and fixed an import preservation gap: same-harness model edits
must retain the package's explicit runner or the existing agent's runner. Native
setup reuses production remote artifact preparation and verifies the actual
app-server/model path; a version number alone does not reject installed Codex.
Known unsupported local/SSH platforms retain legacy defaults. Sandbox support
does not infer an image architecture; setup verifies its actual artifacts.

Public package audit found flat Linux x64 daemons in current stable and canary
server tarballs. Normal release builds stage only the build host's daemon; the
multi-platform assembly helper has no release caller or macOS artifact producer.
Automatic macOS/Windows/Linux ARM defaults therefore remain legacy in this slice.
Existing explicit native agents remain usable with their installed runtime.
macOS runner artifact assembly is a separate prerequisite for its default.
Codex setup required three small Rust seams: read-only probes, observed model
reporting, and reasoning effort. Old cached daemon bytes do not verify these.

Local startup hit the macOS shared-memory ID limit. One detached 56-byte segment
was released only after zero attachments and exited owners were verified. No
running server or database file was changed. The separate QA server is healthy.

Next action: verify the final candidate through existing Linux CI/install checks,
fresh review, and bounded actual journeys. Preserve
failed attempts and costs. Unrelated findings and remaining harness qualification
belong to later slices.

Post-rebase UI checks pass (126 cases, typecheck, token gates). Product E2E
catalog/onboarding support passes (122 cases), plus 47 confirmation fixture
checks and E2E noemit. Existing Pi companion/executor controls pass (26 and 34
cases); core selection/setup passes 87 cases and transport passes six.
Production Storybook build and 26 desktop/six mobile captures were completed
before the Pi rebase; they are component evidence, not live execution proof.
Both final integration gaps are implemented: discovery resolves the selected
environment through the same helper as saving, and explicit native export/import
profiles remain valid on macOS while new automatic defaults stay legacy.
Scoped discovery/authorization passes 63 checks. UI context and recovery checks
pass 280 cases plus three final regressions. Missing discovery metadata shows
loading or the server error with Retry; explicit Legacy remains available.
Final portability checks pass 105 cases; approval, built-in asset and CLI unit
controls pass eight, three and three. The 72 skipped DB cases still need Linux.
Candidate `b7194275e` completed 38 CI checks but failed 14, including aggregate
checks. Its fresh review reported three P1 findings. The fixes preserve explicit
legacy sandbox policy, return refreshed unmanaged subscription credentials to
their authorized source account, and restore gated experimental native choices
for other providers under Advanced. Actor restrictions now run before harness
translation and again on the resolved configuration. Existing route fixtures
use the real resolver; legacy execution controls request Legacy explicitly.
Capability drift was fixed by preserving existing documentation heading anchors,
without changing generated contracts. The retired Codex flag control now uses
an experimental OpenCode profile; all 45 corpus regressions pass locally.
Core regression checks pass 394 cases, with 147 final guard/inheritance controls;
server noemit passes. UI checks pass 212 cases, typecheck and token gates. The
original touch/wheel journeys pass two cases against the isolated preview.
Final desktop/mobile/keyboard captures and the Advanced experimental story are
being checked against the frozen UI tree. Earlier 26 desktop/six mobile/three
keyboard checks passed on the previous UI revision. The built-in regression
checks nondefault settings through runner-only switches in both directions.

Exactly $22 of documented unstarted staging reservations were reassigned to
Codex-only proof: $12 Linux onboarding (one existing campaign, at most two
attempts), $5.50 managed onboarding, $2.50 attended local proof, and $2 incremental
compute/cleanup. The attempted $5 staging setup envelope remains an unknown-cost
hold. Aggregate costs/reservations stay $248.179254104 under the original $250
allocation; no historical unknown or cleanup hold was released. This is not an
invoice-certified balance. No new paid provider task has run in this slice.

Attended local Codex login is pending in the embedded browser at OpenAI security
verification. Staging Fleet Admin requires fresh attended sign-in. The dedicated
QA stack `stack-pool-d06dca5eafe7` and its old immutable environment are identified
historically; current access, serving revision, retained snapshot and physical
cleanup must be verified before reuse. Old archived probe resources and missing
compute billing remain unresolved. Do not substitute old artifacts or passing CI
for these live gates. The next candidate must pass fresh CI and review before
merge sign-off; actual private cloud composition remains post-merge work.


### 2026-10-09 Codex-only candidate qualification update

Frozen execution candidate `38199ea8e6a276eecd35084ad84d691322aba9f4` is rebased
onto master `835a022936ddc7a152b9feab0c0420d02249a6d1`. Its CI completed
48 passing, four failing and four skipped checks. The two substantive failures
are test fixtures: legacy skill expectations on Linux and a credential probe
that depended on a developer daemon. Their narrow corrections pass locally:
77 native/legacy/onboarding skill route cases and the selected-login refresh
regression. The earlier Node 26 skill run ended without a result; it is not proof.
Build, workspace typecheck, all browser E2E shards, policy checks, native
compilation, and the clean public npm consumer pass. The consumer checks all
18 packed packages contain no Codex payload and acquires host Codex from official
npm. The merge and generated-lock CI stamps are recorded separately from source.

The existing Linux Product E2E campaign [37950165589](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/actions/runs/37950165589)
passed its only selected case on attempt one, without a retry. The ordinary
onboarding picker saved `paperclip_runner` / `codex`. All 13 assertions passed,
including an independently checked nonce-bearing document and follow-up with
recorded native execution and the same workspace. Four runs succeeded with
observed model `gpt-5.6-sol`; cleanup passed. Target source is exactly `38199ea8`.
The workflow deliberately applies its verified resolved lock; the source receipt
is dirty and must not be described as a pristine checkout. The report selected
one of 52 catalog cases; it is not the entire catalog qualification.

The final run ledger contains four ready rate-card estimates totaling
$1.265460800 (openai-standard-2026-09-30). Production pricing and accounting
settled. The existing E2E numeric-only cost summary omits decimal-string
costUsdExact and incorrectly reports unpriced/zero; this is a reporting follow-up,
not a production pricing failure. The full $12 campaign hold remains reserved for
setup and invoice uncertainty. Estimates are not provider invoices. No further
paid campaign was dispatched.
The existing public report includes private session identifiers in its result
summary. It is withheld from broad linking while an allowlisted public projection
is added at the existing result seam. Private artifacts and behavioral grading
remain intact. This is an evidence-publication correction, not new eval machinery.

Fresh review scored 3/5, verified the previous three fixes, and found three UI
edge cases: preserve original native setup-link intent on unqualified hosts;
retain built-in settings on runner-only changes; and record an explicit choice
when clicking the displayed automatic default. These fixes pass 171 focused UI
checks, typecheck and token gates. A fresh static build passes; affected visual
proof is in progress. Existing UI verification passed 28 desktop/eight mobile
renders, six keyboard/footer cases and two touch/wheel journeys. Final CI/review
must run after this combined follow-up is frozen.

The isolated preview remains [3125](http://127.0.0.1:3125/COD/dashboard).
Its supervisor now uses the correct port and the backend restarted at
`2026-10-09T15:28:08.305Z`. No user preview or the separate OAuth proxy was stopped.
The first-agent name draft survived reload. The cached local daemon is not proof
of the new native Rust seams; Linux hosted build/live execution supply that proof.
Attended subscription login and current access to the dedicated managed staging
stack remain unresolved. Canonical issue coordination is unavailable because the
original test-drive service is offline; no unrelated company was used for updates.

Next action: finish public-evidence projection and affected UI proof, freeze one
combined follow-up, require green exact-head CI and fresh 5/5 review, then complete
the attended and managed staging journeys when access is available. The PR stays
a draft and is neither merge-ready nor production-ready yet. Merge and production
deployment remain outside authorization.
